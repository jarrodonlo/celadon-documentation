Release Naming Convention
#########################

|C| offers several types of release packages for different usages. Releases
are numbered and tagged according to the release timestamp, the exit
criteria were met, and the Android\* dessert on which the release is based.
The naming convention of a |C| release tag is:

    .. code-block:: none

        [Type]_[Exit Code].[Year].[Quarter].[Work Week]_A[Android Dessert]

    * The *[Type]* field specifies the type of the release package:

        - ':command:`CIV`' denotes a release for running |C| in a VM.

    * The *[Exit Code]* field specifies the code of platform exit stage:

        - ':command:`00`' represents the release is going through the platform exit stage.
        - ':command:`01`' represents the release reaches the platform exit criteria.
        - ':command:`02`' and onward represent sustenancing releases. The number is increased each time a sustenancing package is released.

    * The *[Year]* field represents the Year when the agreed quality
      criteria were met.
    * The *[Quarter]* field represents the Quarter when the agreed quality
      criteria were met.
    * The *[Work Week]* field represents the Work week when the agreed
      quality criteria were met.
    * The *[Android Dessert]* field represents the version of Android
      dessert on which the release is based.
